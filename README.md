## Description

Why I chose NestJS? And why I chose other stack?


## Project setup: compile and run the project

With docker installed, run the following commands:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

All the migrations will be executed automatically. The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.


## Run tests

```bash
$ npm run test
```


With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.


## Backend Guideline

1. Create NestJS Project
2. Install Postgres
3. Install TypeORM
4. Install Docker
5. Install Swagger
6. Create the database
7. Create the Product and endpoints module
8. Create customizations table and endpoints
9. Create customizations and endpoints prohibitions table.
